1) Upload the Image to Docker Hub: coderden/mynginx:v1 (replace and put your username/repo-name)
2) Logout from Docker using the command --> docker logout
3) Create a Kubernetes deployment for the uploaded image
4) Create a Load Balancer service at port 80 for the deployment

This deployment will fail since Kubernetes does not have credentials to pull the image

5) Create a Kubernetes secret

kubectl create secret docker-registry mydockersecret --docker-username="<USERNAME>" --docker-password "<PASSWORD>" --docker-server=docker.io

6) Verify that secret is created

kubectl get secrets

7) Mention the docker secret in the deployment yaml under Pod spec section
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mynginx-container
        image: coderden/mynginx:v1
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
      imagePullSecrets:
        - name: mydockersecret

8) apply the deployment yaml file
9) Pods must be in running state since image pull will be successful
