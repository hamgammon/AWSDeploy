<!-- 1) create a html file on your local machine (index.html)

2) upload that file to an s3 bucket from your local machine (create bucket if not existing)
aws s3 cp index.html s3://demobucket250

3) create an IAM policy which gives read-only access to mydemobucket2050 (use IAM service)
	(add /* after the bucket name in the policy JSON)

4) create an IAM Role and assign the policy created in step 3 (EC2 service can read from S3 bucket)

5) create a security group with ports 22 and 80 open for Inbound traffic (create it from EC2 dashboard)

6) create SSH Key (from EC2 dashboard)

7) create an EC2 instance and use the html file from S3 bucket as our index.html page for the web server 
installed in EC2 (user data should be used to install web server and copy from S3 to web server folder)

a) select the role created in step 5 in the IAM instance profile dropdown (Advances details section)

b) user data for EC2 instance -->

#!/bin/bash
yum update -y
yum install httpd -y
systemctl start httpd
systemctl enable httpd
aws s3 cp s3://mydemobucket2050/index.html /var/www/html/
